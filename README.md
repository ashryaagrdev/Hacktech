# Tinder
- This project is intended to be a small scale web based version of tinder .
- The frameworks and tools I will be using :
    - NodeJS
    - MongoDB
    - MongoDB atlas
    - Robo3t
    - Webstorm
    - Heroku ( for deployment )
    - REST API and Express
    - Postman ( testing of API endpoints)
 - I have worked with these individually for small taks while follwoing tutorials
    , but  I wanted to get something tangible. This web app serves this purpose .
 - To run this app in development mode :
 ```bash
 npm run dev
 ```
 - To run it in normal settings :
 ```bash
 npm run start
 ```
 - If this package is being run for the first time, following things are request:
    - The system should have npm and mongodb
    - Use the following command to install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```   
 - The frontend of the app is going to be basic with less design and styling .
 - I could not find any other good and meaningful project that is not done yet....
   so picked up this project .
